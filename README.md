# SwiftUI Programming üèÜ

This repo will contain a wide range of different apps written with Swift with SwiftUI on purpose to make me a better programmer. </br>
The level of difficulty will increase with time. </br>
Apps here are part of this [course](https://codewithchris.com/) üëÄ.</br>
I try to learn things that I don't know and also add some extra features for each app. </br>
Take a look and ask my questions about it‚ùï </br>
